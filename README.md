# Microsoft Entra ID Custom authentication extension with SDK sample


Within Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Entra External ID's sign-up and sign-in user flow, there are built-in authentication events. You can also add [custom authentication extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/custom-extension-overview) at specific points within the authentication flow. A custom authentication extension is essentially an event listener that, when activated, makes an HTTP call to a REST API endpoint where you define a workflow action. For example, you could use a custom claims provider to add external user data to the token before the token is issued.

## Azure Function sample

This Azure Function (WebJob) sample code demonstrates how to create a web API for using the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.AuthenticationEvents](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.AuthenticationEvents) NuGet library and set it up for authentication. You'll create an HTTP trigger function in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, configure it for authentication, and deploy it to the Azure portal, where it can be accessed through Azure Functions. Learn how to configure and run the [sample code](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/custom-extension-tokenissuancestart-setup?tabs=visual-studio%2Cazure-portal&pivots=nuget-library). 

> [!NOTE]
>
> The [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.AuthenticationEvents](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.AuthenticationEvents) NuGet library is currently in preview. Steps in this article are subject to change. For general availability implementation of implementing a token issuance start event, you can do so using the [Azure Function without the SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/custom-authentication-extension).

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of the concepts covered in [Custom authentication extensions overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/custom-extension-overview).
- An Azure subscription with the ability to create Azure Functions. If you don't have an existing Azure account, sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) or use your [Visual Studio Subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/) benefits when you [create an account](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).
- A Microsoft Entra ID tenant. You can use either a customer or workforce tenant for this how-to guide.
- One of the following IDEs and configurations:
    - Visual Studio Code, with the [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) extension enabled.
    - Visual Studio with [Azure Development workload for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/azure/configure-visual-studio) configured.

## Other samples

This sampel code is based on the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.AuthenticationEvents](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.AuthenticationEvents) NuGet library is currently in preview. Check out the [Azure Function sample](https://github.com/microsoft/custom-authentication-extension) (without the SDK). It provides code samples for all events.
